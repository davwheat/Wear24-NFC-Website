            Data which we collect from you may be stored and processed in and
            transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area

            transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual
            clauses adopted by the European Commission, or by signing up to the
            EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, in the event that the organisation
            in receipt of the Data is based in the United States of America.
