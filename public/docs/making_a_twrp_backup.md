# Making a Backup

## Warnings and Notices

- This guide is not exhaustive and you may run into issues while following the instructions. You have to _use your common sense_ and if you really need help, [join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pDWsFGY) and ask a question in the `#support` channel.

- We (anyone part of this project) are not responsible for ANY damage to yourself, the device or anything else. This includes your mental sanity which you may lose.

- This process should not be undertaken unless you recognise that your device may become bricked. I repeat: **do not do this if you are not prepared to be left with a \$75 WearOS paperweight!**

## Method

Short one!

This part is a pain for multiple reasons but it will save your watch.

**Do it.**

You need to go to `Backup` and select `System` and `Boot`. This backup will use just under 1GB of your watch's internal storage. If you're not comfortable with that, you can transfer it to your phone using NavExplorer then upload it to a computer or cloud storage. Just know that if you ever need to use this backup, it must be on your watch. If it's not, you will have to hold your hand very steady on the contacts for a _long_ time while the data transfers. You could solder, but that won't be nice to remove.
