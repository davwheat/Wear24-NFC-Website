## Method

Now that's out of the way, it's time to get to opening your watch. Stated below is the best method. Under it there is the exact steps to how davwheat did it.

Opening the Wear24 is necessary for any low-level changes to the system. Verizon's dock does not support data transfer, rather, the USB pins are located on a board inside the watch.

Please be aware that opening the watch will defeat the IP67 wear resistance rating. This can likely be re-obtained by using a sealant. Community members have used Flex Seal, but neither Jared nor davwheat have.

In order to open the Wear24, you will need a small (0.6mm) tri-wing (Y000) screwdriver, metal/plastic pry tools, and a hot hair dryer or heat gun. We also recommend suction cups and other phone disassembly kits.

First, make sure you turn the Wear24 off from Settings > System > Power Off. Once the watch is off, you can flip it over. We recommend removing the straps to avoid damage, but this is optional. The straps are held in by two screws for each band. The pins for the antennas will be exposed when you remove the bands. Do not bend these pins or lose the rubber O-Rings. You may replace these bands with 20mm quick release bands, but note that this leaves the antenna ports exposed. If you plan to keep IP67, you'll need to seal these.

Remove the four tri-wing screws from the back casing of the watch. These will have adhesive on them. A pair of tweezers may help remove them from the casing. Heat the back so that it is too hot to touch, but beware of warping or melting the plastic. If you do damage the back cover, it is only cosmetic, so don't feel bad. It's very likely that you will damage it. Once the back is heated, Attempt to pry from the top-right corner or right edge, below the lip. This requires patience and may require more than one pry tool at a time. You may also find success using a small, sharp tool to stab into the side of the back. A phone screen suction tool may prove very useful.

<span style="color:red">**CAUTION!**</span>
When inserting a pry tool below the cover, be cautious, It is possible to slip it underneath the SIM board and damage that board's connector. Only lift the back cover.

---

Once the back cover is off, you're in. Peel back the wireless charging coil and let it hang outside the casing, out of the way. Remove the black sponge found on the SIM board to expose the contacts. If you are not a Verizon customer, it's recommended to remove the SIM card by sliding it up past where the sponge was. If you have no reason to, do not disassemble further.

## davwheat's Method

<span style="color:orange">**WARNING**</span>
This is DEFINITELY not the best way to do it. It worked for me. Don't complain when you puncture your battery and your house catches fire.

---

1. Don't use a heat gun. Heat guns are dumb and deserve to be nuked off of Planet Earth.
2. Take off the watch bands and back casing screws.
3. Use a screwdriver you hate or cost \$1 from eBay to make a small hole on one corner of the back cover of the watch.
4. Slide a small set of tweezers into the gap you made and start prying up **SLOWLY**.
5. As the adhesive pulls away slightly, use the file from a nail clipper to keep a gap open. Yes. I did that.
6. Slide the tweezers around the edge of the casing slowly. It can be tough. _Be patient_.
7. Don't puncture your battery or slice any ribbon cabled: don't push the tweezers too far in or too far down. I almost did. That is not fun.
8. Fully remove the back casing.
9. Use your fingernails (NO TOOLS) to peel off the wireless charging coil. Don't bend it too much or you'll break it.
10. Slide the SIM out towards the black rectangle if you don't wanna use Verizon's services.
11. Peel off the black rectangle sponge using your fingernails again The test points are below this. It didn't want to come off easily, but I used my patience.
12. You're done.
