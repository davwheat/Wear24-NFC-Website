## Warnings and Notices

- This guide is not exhaustive and you may run into issues while following the instructions. You have to _use your common sense_ and if you really need help, [join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pDWsFGY) and ask a question in the `#support` channel.

- We (anyone part of this project) are not responsible for ANY damage to yourself, the device or anything else. This includes your mental sanity which you may lose.

## Create your own

Use a USB cable that is capable of data transfer. Flat wire cables are not recommended as they usually use thin uncoated wire which is much more difficult to work with. Older Type-B or Micro-B cables work well.

Cut off the end of the USB cable that is not the 'A' connector (one that connects to your PC) using a pair of wire cutters. Strip this end of the wire of its outer coating using a box cutter knife or a set of wire strippers. You should find red, white, green and black wires inside. Strip these too.

If your wires are flexible/made of multiple very thin wires wound together, it's recommended to use some sturdy wire (solid core) to reinforce them. Wrap the flexible wire around the new wire and seal the two using heat shrink tubing. You could solder these if you have the correct equipment, too.

Use adhesive to put these wires together in the order of RWGB (5V, Data+, Data-, GND). Electrical tape is recommended so you can realign the cables to line up with the pinouts if need be. Afterwards, you can coat the tape and wires in hot glue if you so desire.
